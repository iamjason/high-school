# A Patriot's Plan for the Future
This short essay was written for a Knight's of Columbus contest ~1999.  The topic was patriotism or American patriots...  I don't remember the details, but it was a required assignment for the class. 

### HISTORY
I was not a fan of the Knight's namesake...  nor was I a fan of the Federal holiday celebrating him.  The boy's a sex-slave-trading-ego-maniac at best .  So, I thought it would be perfect/funny/ironic to enter an essay contest proclaiming Hitler as a patriot.  These guy's seem to love genicidial maniacs (the boy is Chris Columbus if anyone is still in the dark)... So, let's give'em the greatest one the Earth has seen.

### MOTIVATION
This brings me to Trump.  His hatred-misogamy-xenophobia is unworthy of the Whitehouse. 

### Notes
Thanks Mom for hunting this down faster than I could text back, "Don't worry about it."


### Note to the Second Ammendment D-Bags
1. This is not about guns.  No one is talking about taking your guns. Just, STOP.  The quote was researched (in a library) an entire year before I knew Google existed.  So, I probably could've found something more applicable had I give just a little more shit.  

2. Do you really want to support a Hitler quote?
